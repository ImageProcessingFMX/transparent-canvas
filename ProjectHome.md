TTransparentCanvas is a TCanvas-like class for drawing partially transparent text and shapes using plain GDI (no GDI+ or DirectX.)  It supports drawing its content to a normal TCanvas, and is also useful for painting on glass areas on a form.  It includes a sample project showing drawing to a paintbox and glass.
